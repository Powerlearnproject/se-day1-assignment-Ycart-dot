#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

IDEs automates the software development process by providing a single environment to code and execute (debug) your application means productivity increases in coordination. With VCS, you can manage source code changes and support teamwork as well as create backup & restore strategies for safe development practices. This is mainly in the form of industry standard tools (e.g. Visual Studio, Git) etc
What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Common complications and procedures:

1. Meet complex requirements:
   - Difficulty: The product requirements of the program may be vague, incomplete or often excessive, something that makes it difficult to meet user expectations.
   - Methods: Use requirements management techniques such as posting detailed documentation, regular stakeholder engagement and strategic actions to implement changes in the. Use clear communication channels and maintain traceable requirements matrix.

2. Technical costs used:
   - Difficulty: Accumulation of Å technology costs from quick solutions or poor quality solutions can lead to challenges of high maintenance and upgrade costs in the long run.
   - Methods:Refactors permanent rules, implements rule changes and prioritizes technical cost management during the development process. Allowing time for processing is important along with business development to ensure long-term quality of the code.

3. Make sure system features are good:
   - Challenge: It can be challenging to ensure software meets quality standards, including delivery, security and accessibility.
   - Methods: Implements a comprehensive testing framework including unit, integration, system and acceptance testing. Use automated testing tools, continuous integration and continuous classification (CI/CD) practices to ensure quality throughout the development lifecycle.

4. Dealing with changing technology:
   - Challenge:Rapid advances in technology and applications can make it difficult for engineers to stay up-to-date and make informed decisions.
   - Strategy: Invest in continuous improvement and professional development. Encourage participation in technical resources, attend industry events and promote a culture of ongoing learning within the team.

  

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing: As the name suggests this is to testing a units/components individually in isolation i.e., early detection of errors/code quality.

Integration testing tests how the components work together and exchange data i.e., test communication between those component logs when they are combined due to whatever causes that.

System Testing: The complete integrated system should be tested for sufficient amount of transactions as that whats required, to guarantee the requirements are met, and authenticated functionality in a functional environment.

The acceptance test is conducted to verify that an application product meets the user's need and standard before it comes for distribution, also ensure usability & performance requirement are met.

At different stages of the testing process -- each serves its own purposes and is necessary as one kind cannot substitute another in revealing issues preventing your system working correctly.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of designing and redesigning prompts, questions or instructions to interact logically with the AI ​​model for desired outputs. This requires careful feedback that gives the model a very clear idea of ​​what it needs or, conversely, what it is looking for from the AI, which will allow it to interpret and he answers the question correctly

Importance.

1. Improves Accuracy: Unstructured feedback will help the AI ​​model establish the context and context of the request, thus finding the right answer. According to him, explicit presentation will eliminate most of the ambiguity, thereby closing the gap between what the image produces and what the user expects

2. Improves efficiency: Stating the specific requirements or limitations of the presentation can save time in providing necessary information or results rather than asking for follow-up information it is clearly defined.

3. Better results: Effective leading-edge technologies help users harness the full potential of an AI model for creative content creation, complex analysis, or consumption address a specific problem, thus increasing the value of communication.

4. Reduces misunderstanding:A well-designed prompt avoids misinterpretation and enables the AI ​​to provide any relevant and useful information, thus improving the overall user experience . . . .

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague prompt:"Describe data structures".
Improved prompt: "Compare the use of arrays and linked lists and compare differences in memory efficiency, speed of access, and ease of insertion or deletion."

Why the improved prompt is more effective:

1. Clarity:It clearly states the two data structures to be compared (arrays and linked lists) and the objects to be compared: memory efficiency, access speed, and insertion/deletion.
2. Specificity:The direction of the prompt regarding the comparison—making the information more useful and relevant.
3. Conciseness: A concise presentation ensures that the description is directly relevant to the user's need for comparative understanding.

It helps generate detailed, focused responses and direct responses to key concerns and comparisons.
